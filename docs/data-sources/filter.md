# stackoverflow_filter (Data Source)

The `filter` data source allows for referencing an existing filter in Stack Overflow. This can be used to import an existing filter that
may not have the proper fields returned for the types used by the provider. It is recommended to only import filters that have been created
by the Terraform Provider for Stack Overflow to ensure that the correct fields will be returned by the API.  See the following article for
more details about [custom filters](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/filters) in the Stack Overflow API.

As an alternative to importing an existing filter, users can export the filter ID using Terraform output and use a remote state data source
to reuse a single filter across multiple Terraform repositories.

## Example
```
data "stackoverflow_filter" "filter" {
    filter = "XXXX"
}
```
