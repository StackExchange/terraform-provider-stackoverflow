# stackoverflow_filter (Resource)

Manages a filter used to interact with the underlying Stack Overflow API. This resource has no fields and is automatically created with the required return fields. It is recommended to create one filter per set of Terraform IaC or reuse a filter across Terraform IaC code sets by exporting the filter and using a remote state data source to access the filter identifier.

## Example

```
resource "stackoverflow_filter" "filter" {
}

resource "stackoverflow_article" "article" {
  article_type = "announcement"
  title = "Terraform Provider for Stack Overflow is available!"
  body_markdown = "Look for the Stack Overflow provider in the Terraform registry"
  tags = ["example"]
  filter = stackoverflow_filter.filter.id
}
```
